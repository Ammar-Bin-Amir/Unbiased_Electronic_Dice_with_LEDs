# Unbiased Electronic Dice with LEDs

This project consists of six LEDs, a 555 Timer IC and a 4017 Decade Counter IC by which a random number is produced somewhere in the range of 1 to 6 by lighting up the corresponding LED when the push switch is pressed, reducing the biasing factor which is found on the normal dices.
